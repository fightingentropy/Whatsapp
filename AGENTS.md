# ZapFast Silicon agent guide

ZapFast Silicon is an Apple Silicon-only fork of crmne/ZapFast: Rust, egui, and the
[whatsapp-rust](https://github.com/oxidezap/whatsapp-rust) library for the
protocol. These notes are for coding agents and new contributors.

## Product boundaries

- Keep it a small native client. No browser engine, no telemetry, no
  hosted backend, no second account system.
- The protocol comes from whatsapp-rust. Do not reimplement pieces of it
  here, and do not advertise a capability merely because a protobuf field
  for it exists.
- Do not broaden a task into adjacent features or a general refactor.
  Preserve existing user behaviour unless the task changes it.

## Architecture

- `src/ui/` draws views and pushes `model::Action`s; `src/app.rs` applies
  them after the frame. Never mutate application state from inside a view
  beyond the view's own fields (composer text, search text, flags).
- `src/backend.rs` is the interface's handle to a tokio runtime on its own
  thread; `src/backend/worker.rs` runs there. It owns the whatsapp-rust
  `Bot`, the message archive, downloads, and profile pictures. The two
  sides talk only through `Command` (interface to runtime) and `Event`
  (runtime to interface); every event wakes the window through `Waker`.
- `src/archive.rs` is the SQLite store of chats, messages, contacts, and
  privacy-id mappings. WhatsApp replays history once, at link time, so the
  archive is the only copy. It keeps each message's raw protobuf because
  the keys to fetch an attachment live in it.
- `src/model.rs` holds the app's own types. Views never touch a protobuf;
  the worker translates in `classify()` and `parse_conversation()`.
- Chat ids are canonical strings: a chat behind a privacy id (`@lid`) is
  filed under its phone number once the mapping is known. Use
  `Worker::canonical` for anything that arrives as a `Jid`.
- `src/theme.rs` owns colours, fonts, and icons; `src/ui/widgets.rs` the
  shared controls. New icons go in `assets/icons/` as 24px Lucide-style SVGs
  and in the `icons!` table.
- `src/markup.rs` turns WhatsApp's text markup, links, and mentions into an
  egui `LayoutJob`; `src/emoji.rs` swaps every emoji for a placeholder
  glyph at layout time and paints the desktop's colour emoji bitmap over
  it afterwards (resolving sequences through the font's GSUB ligatures).
  Any text that can hold an emoji goes through `widgets::line` /
  `widgets::rich_text` or `markup::layout`, never a bare `Label`.
- `src/animation.rs` plays animated stickers and GIFs: WebP/GIF frames
  decode in-process, and so do MP4s (the `mp4` crate demuxes, `openh264`
  decodes the H.264 WhatsApp uses, samples converted from AVCC to Annex
  B); `ffmpeg` is only a fallback for other codecs. `openh264` compiles
  its C++ from source with the C++ compiler of the host; `nasm` is
  optional and only adds the SIMD paths (the AUR recipes leave it out,
  the build works without it). Frames share one playback texture per clip on the interface
  thread. The CPU frame cache is bounded by bytes and expires unseen clips.
- Message bodies paint through `markup::paint_selectable` and single lines
  through `widgets::selectable_rich_text`: both hand the galley to
  `egui::text_selection::LabelSelectionState` (which paints it) and only
  overlay the colour emoji, so text can be swept and copied while
  `style.interaction.selectable_labels` stays false for every other label.
  The response must sense clicks and drags. `SelectionLeash` (an egui
  `input_hook` plugin) clamps a drag that started in the message view to
  just inside its edge once the pointer strays out (the platform keeps
  reporting a grabbed pointer beyond the window), and drops mid-drag
  `PointerGone`, so the selection keeps a row under it while the edge
  scroll brings more past. A copy that sweeps across
  messages is rebuilt by `src/transcript.rs` with `[time, date] Name:`
  per message (the phone's sharing format): every drawn body lands in
  `App::copy_rows` each frame, and the `CopyAnnotator` egui plugin
  rewrites the queued `CopyText` in `output_hook`, the only hook that
  runs after the selection plugin's own end-of-pass flush (plugins run
  in registration order and the built-ins come first, so end-pass
  callbacks fire too early).
  Selection galleys share the message viewport's horizontal bounds while
  retaining their glyph positions: otherwise egui considers short incoming
  and outgoing messages separate columns and will not sweep across them.
- Group names and members come from `groups().get_metadata`, asked one
  turn at a time (two per 5 s tick, `pump_group_info`): dozens of unnamed
  groups arrive with history sync and a burst of queries hits the
  server's rate limit, which once left groups called "Group" forever.
  Failures back off (30 s doubling, seven tries); item-not-found,
  forbidden and not-authorized are final and stop the asking.
- A download that answers 403/404/410 goes through
  `client.media_reupload().request(..)` (a server-error receipt; WhatsApp
  has the phone re-upload and answers with a fresh `direct_path`) and is
  fetched once more before the bubble reports "No longer on WhatsApp's
  servers". Download failures never toast; they live in the bubble as
  "... · click to retry". Copied text is refined by
  `transcript::refine`: emoji placeholders map back through each row's
  `placements`.
- History sync can bring a chat with a name and no messages at all; a
  history request for such a chat is anchored at the present with an
  empty message id (`worker::fetch_older`), and the app asks the phone
  as soon as such a chat loads or opens, instead of never.
- `eframe`'s `glow_options` turn vsync off: a Wayland compositor stops
  sending frame callbacks to a window on a hidden workspace, a vsync wait
  there blocks the event loop and its ping replies, and Hyprland then
  calls the app unresponsive. Repaints are event-driven, so nothing spins.
- `src/voice.rs` is the codec for voice messages: OGG/Opus in and out
  (the `ogg` crate for the container, `opus` with libopus bundled and
  built by cmake for the codec, so cmake is a build dependency), plus
  the 64-bar waveform WhatsApp draws and a mono/48 kHz resampler.
  `src/audio.rs` is the sound: `Player` plays one clip at a time through
  rodio (OGG/Opus through `voice`, MP3/M4A/WAV through rodio's decoders,
  decoded on a thread, the device opened on demand and released when the
  clip ends) and `Recorder` reads the default microphone through rodio's
  `Microphone` on a thread, keeping a loudness per 50 ms for the live bars.
  Linux needs ALSA headers to build (`libasound2-dev` on Debian,
  `alsa-lib` on Arch). `Action::PlayVoice/SeekVoice` drive the player from
  the bubble; `StartRecording/CancelRecording/SendRecording` the
  microphone from the composer (the send button is a microphone when there
  is nothing to send); `Command::SendVoice` normalizes
  (`voice::normalize`, quiet takes up to just under full scale, gain
  capped), encodes and sends push-to-talk with the waveform and the reply
  quote if one was open; `Command::MarkPlayed` sends the played receipt
  once per incoming voice message. Own bubbles lay out right-aligned,
  where egui turns `ui.horizontal` right to left: rows like the voice
  player must use an explicit `Layout::left_to_right` at their own width.
  `src/ui/picker.rs` is the emoji/GIF/sticker panel. GIF search uses the
  key from Settings, else one baked in at build time from
  `ZAPFAST_GIPHY_KEY` (`option_env!`); the repository carries none. The
  phone's recently used stickers arrive in `HistorySync.recent_stickers`
  when the device links and live in the archive's `stickers` table as raw
  `StickerMetadata`, fetched when the picker opens; favourite stickers sync
  through app state (`FavoriteSticker`), which whatsapp-rust does not
  surface, so they are not shown.
- The fork uses `org.erlin.zapfast-silicon` storage and bundle identity, its
  own single-instance port/protocol and its own GitHub release endpoint. Never
  automatically adopt an upstream session. Legacy migration helpers are retained
  for reference and tests, but startup does not call them.
- The app outlives the window, as in Spotifast: `main` runs
  `eframe::run_native` in a loop; closing the window with "keep running"
  on sets `hide_intent`, the window is destroyed, and a headless loop keeps
  calling `App::background_frame` (the link, the archive, the tray) until
  the tray, a clicked notification, or another launch sets `wants_show`,
  when a new window is made. `src/tray.rs` is the Linux status notifier
  (ksni), `src/tray_native.rs` the Windows and macOS item (tray-icon; on
  macOS made with the first window and pumped by `tray::idle` while none
  exists). `src/single_instance.rs` holds a loopback port so a second
  launch surfaces the first. `src/notify.rs` sends desktop notifications
  for `Event::Incoming` (live messages from others, not history) when the
  reader is away from that chat. macOS has no title bar: the content runs
  to the top. `src/macos.rs` keeps native application menus alive across window
  recreation and aligns traffic lights with the chat header. Linking retains
  `ui::titlebar_strip`; other headers reserve horizontal space for the buttons.
- Group delivery uses `archive::receipts`: save the recipients when filing an
  outgoing message, record each person's receipt, then take the least advanced
  recipient. Never promote a group from one reader, apply a receipt to earlier
  messages, or infer a historical audience from current membership. History
  trusts the phone's aggregate status, not a partial `user_receipt` list.
- The name and icon under the phone's Linked devices come from
  `DevicePropsOverride` in `start_bot` (`os` is the name shown, the
  platform type picks the icon); WhatsApp reads them at pairing only, so a
  change shows after unlinking and linking again.
- Older history comes from the phone on demand (`Command::FetchOlder` →
  `Client::fetch_message_history` → a `HistorySync` chunk with
  `sync_type == ON_DEMAND`); the archive is paged first, the phone only
  when it is exhausted.
- This fork targets `aarch64-apple-darwin` only, including CI and packaging.
  Keep the M1 baseline; do not use `target-cpu=native` for distributable builds.
  Legacy platform branches can remain for upstream comparison, but they are not
  supported build targets. Respect the explicit Mac-only scope.

Three egui pitfalls this code has already hit:

- `consume_key(Modifiers::NONE, key)` also matches the key with Shift held
  (egui only insists on the modifiers you ask for), so the composer
  inspects the events itself to tell Enter from Shift+Enter.
- `with_layout(..., Align::Center)` directly inside a vertical container
  claims the whole available height; wrap it in `ui.horizontal`.
- `ui.horizontal` inside a right-aligned bubble lays out right to left;
  see `mirrored_row`. A bubble's own click target is registered before its
  contents (from last frame's rect) so links and quotes inside win clicks.
- `Popup::context_menu` opens on the *response's* right-click, which those
  inner widgets take for themselves; the bubble reads the right-click from
  the input over its own rect and opens `Popup::menu` itself, so the menu
  comes up anywhere on the message.

## Releasing

Do not cut a release for every fix. Work accumulates on `main` until
there is something substantial to announce: a feature, or a batch of
fixes worth a changelog entry. Five patch releases in a day is what this
rule exists to prevent. The exception is a regression in something just
released, which goes out as soon as it is fixed.

A release is not finished when the tag is pushed. Do these in order:

1. Bump `version` in `Cargo.toml` and update `Cargo.lock` with a build. Run
   the full checks, commit, and push before tagging so the binaries report
   the right version.
2. Tag `vX.Y.Z` and push the tag. Wait for the Apple Silicon DMG and
   `checksums.txt`; verify signing and notarization, not just compilation.
3. Write release notes about the final user-visible behavior and validation.
   Publish only to fightingentropy/zapfast. Do not publish the inherited website,
   upstream packages, AUR or Homebrew repositories from this fork.

## Definition of done

- Add focused tests for changed behaviour. The `demo` feature carries sample
  data and a headless layout test of every screen (`src/demo.rs`); extend
  the sample when a new kind of content or state is added, and use
  `--demo-shot` to look at the result.
- Update the README when user-visible behaviour, settings, files, or network
  access changes.
- Run the full checks before finishing:

  ```sh
  cargo fmt --all --check
  cargo clippy --locked --all-targets -- -D warnings
  cargo clippy --locked --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
  cargo test --locked --all-targets
  cargo test --locked --all-targets --all-features
  RUSTDOCFLAGS='-D warnings' cargo doc --locked --all-features --no-deps
  ```

  Do not weaken a lint, delete a test, or add an `allow` merely to make
  them pass without explaining why the rule does not apply.
- Report platform coverage honestly: say what was run and what was only
  compiled.
- Never log message contents, phone numbers, keys, or QR payloads at a
  level that ships. The log file is meant to be attached to bug reports.
